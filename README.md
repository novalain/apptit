======

Cooking recipe application with focus on lunchboxes for students made in Ionic/AngularJS. 
Setup Ionic and your emulators and run

```ionic emulate ios``` or ```ionic emulate android```

you can also run just ```ionic serve```, but that is going to be quite an ugly experience.
This project really needs to be refactored and cleaned.
